# Weather Station Final Project

## Introduction

This project is a weather station that collects and stores weather data using MongoDB as the database, Express.js for the API, and Arduino for the sensor program.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the project, make sure you have the following:

- Arduino board with compatible sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure)
- MongoDB installed and running
- Node.js and npm installed

## Setup

### Arduino

1. Connect the sensors to your Arduino board according to their specifications.
2. Install the necessary libraries for the sensors using the Arduino Library Manager.
3. Write a program in Arduino IDE to read data from the sensors and send it to the API.

### MongoDB

[Installation Link](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

### Express.js API

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Make sure the Arduino sensor is running.
3. Adjust the code base on your network ip address.
4. Due to network restriction at school, this project use local mongoDB instead.

## Usage

1. Upload the Arduino program to your Arduino board.
2. Start the Express.js server by running `node server.js`.
3. The Arduino board will start sending sensor data to the API.
4. The API will store the data in the MongoDB database.
5. You can retrieve the weather data by making requests to the appropriate API endpoints.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a weather station project using MongoDB, Express.js, and Arduino. You can now collect and store weather data and retrieve it through the API.
